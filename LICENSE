Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with
two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this
License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements
made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread
use, become available for other developers to incorporate.  Many
developers of commercial software contribute to the community in this
way.  However, software that uses the GNU General Public License does
not require the source code of modified versions to be released to the
public unless you release those versions to the public.

Questions have arisen about software that interacts with users across a
network but is not released.  server-side software, for example.  When
such software is publicly released, the GNU General Public License
permits users to run the software for any purpose, access the source
code, modify it, and distribute modified versions to others.  However,
the GNU General Public License does not require you to make source code
available if you simply run a modified version of server-side software
for your own internal business purposes.

To address this problem, the Affero General Public License requires that
the modified source code be made available to any user interacting with
the software across a network.  Thus, the Affero General Public License
ensures that if you run a modified server, you must provide source code
to the users of that server.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
